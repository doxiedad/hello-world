# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

Hi! My name is Robert Barrett, but I go by my middle name, Chris. 
Right now I'm taking courses on Codecademy and learning to use GitHub
so that I can store the projects I create during my courses. I also
hope to practice doing some code reviews as well.

If you come along and see this file, feel free to say hi at:
chris.barrett@slu.edu

Peace!
